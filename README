1. Configuration Instructions

The application is running on a Raspharry PI 3 model B. This PI should come
with a USB sound card, a network connection, a microphone.

1.1 Configure USB sound card as default audio device

	1.1.1. RPi onboard sound card doesn.t have microphone interface. We have
	 to change the default audio device to be USB sound card.
	1.1.2. Boot up RPi, and apply the USB sound card. Use 'lsusb' command
	 to check if your USB sound card is mounted.
	1.1.3. Use 'sudo nano /etc/asound.conf.command'and put following 
	content to the file:
	
	pcm.!default {
		type plug
		slave {
		pcm "hw:1,0"
		}
	}
	ctl.!default {
		type hw
		card 1
	}

	1.1.4. Go to your home directory. Use 'nano .asoundrc' command and put
	 the same content to the file.
	1.1.5. Run 'alsamixer' you should be able to see that USB sound card
	is the default audio device. For a more sensitive sound detection, 
	it is better to maximize the volume of 'Mic'.

1.2 Install libcurl

	1.2.1 First use command "ls /usr/include/curl" or 
	"ls /usr/include/arm-linux-gnueabihf/curl" to identify that libcurl
	 library is installed.
	1.2.2 If the folder doesn't exist. Run 'sudo apt-get update' to update
	 the application list.
	1.2.3 Run 'sudo apt-get install libcurl3' to install the libcurl3.
	1.2.4 Run 'sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev' to install the
	 development API of libcurl4.
